### On this GitHub account, I'll store my open-source projects, experiments, analytics, and miscellaneous items.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with around 10y of experience. I still love coding, but working in Scrum has completely drained my energy. I genuinely hate this process, so I created [this blog](https://escapefromscrum.com) as a public diary to document my journey of escaping Scrum and trying to quit being a corporate-rat.
